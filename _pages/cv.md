An experienced agile, servant leader.

I help teams deliver the software that users need.  

I use modern UX, Lean and agile methods to help policy, data and engineering teams do their best work.  

My teams run like clockwork, are creative, fun, and are a safe place to experiment.  

I simplify complex issues and help teams focus on value.
