👋👋🏽👋🏿 Hello hello! Here's what I'm up to. Or, you can always [read my CV](/cv.html)

## Reading 
[Slow Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223296158-slow-gods) by Claire North. 

I’m not done yet, but I'm calling it now. It’s the best book I’ve read this year. I’ve been longing for a book like this for such a long time. It really wasn’t much into its world building when I thought to myself: ‘Yes! This is the one’ and it hasn’t let me down since. 

Also recently finished [Air](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218553007-air), by John Boyne. It’s a short read about a father and his relationship with his teenage son. Recommended to me by staff at Hertford library, I will trust them in future.

## Playing 
Just finished [Dispatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/) - we’ve been spoiled by fantastic video games in 2025, and Dispatch has brought me lots of joy. I did a couple of play throughs to see the different paths that your decisions take you… and of course, performed better than 99% of other players during the Dispatch missions. 

I’ve found that I've fallen into the pit of Oxygen Not Included again - both in game form, and Youtube form. I may need to deploy the emergency exit before another thousand hours disappear into it. Making this website is helping. 

## Working and hurting 
I still work with the fantastic [GOV.UK Pay team](https://www.payments.service.gov.uk/) and am just about to start some work to help new starters become confident active contributors as quickly as possible from their start date. This is a really important part of getting the ‘experience of working on Pay’ right (I don’t say developer experience, because we’re a multi-disciplinary lot, but do take lots of inspiration from Dev Ex ideas).

I’m also going to work on some training material for leading an incident response with an aim to empower fast decision making when things go wrong. 

I’m hopefully putting a pin in the end of 60 days of chronic pain caused (we think) by a type of arthritis. (Why do I find this so hard to spell???) It’s been awful and it’s going to take me a number of months to properly recover. I had a fall today in the park, because I stupidly walked in the rain without my stick and slipped on a rain sodden wooden bridge. My own fault - I will spend the next few rainy days being much more sensible when getting out and about. A friend shared this article with me when I said that [swearing was an effective painkiller](https://www.emsuklearning.co.uk/swearing-as-analgesia-the-evidence-behind-profanity-and-pain-relief/) in the moment - turns out that's true! Love how this article uses the [what, so what? now what! liberating structure](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/) to summarise the content at the end. 

At home I'm working on this site - and my health, both physically and mentally.   

## Christmas
I don’t really celebrate Christmas - but I don’t expect my niece (3yrs f) and nephew (1yr m) to understand that. So I'm taking any recommendations from parents for great gift ideas.
