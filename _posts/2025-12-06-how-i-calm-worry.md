I worry a lot. Maybe you do too.

Interviews. Workshops. Big pieces of work. Worry can be about anything.

My mind jumps ahead and tries to solve problems that don’t exist yet.

*Will this go well? What if it doesn’t? Will people find it useful? Am I doing the right thing?*

When someone tells me to “stop worrying”, it never helps. I need to hear it from myself.

This exercise gives me a way to do that.

## Try this

Find a quiet place where you won’t be overheard. A bathroom works well because you can look yourself in the eye.

Start with a minute of silence. Deep breaths in and out.

Think about the thing that’s worrying you. Then **brainstorm the people in your life who want you to do well.**  
All of them. Family. Friends. Colleagues. Anyone who’s in your corner.

Give yourself a reminder that you’re not doing any of this alone.

### Say it out loud

Start with yourself:

```html
"I want to do well with this interview / workshop / meeting."
```

Then say the names of the people who want you to do well. It might feel odd at first, but stay with it.

```html
"I know my mum and dad want me to do well."
"My sister and her husband want me to do well."
```

Move to the people around you:

```html
"My boss wants me to do well."
"The people I work with want me to do well — there’s Sarah, Jane, Susan..."
```

Keep going for two or three minutes, or as long as you can keep coming up with people.

When you reach the end, take another breath:

```html
"I want to do well, and all of these people want me to do well too."
```

Every time I do this, the weight on my shoulders gets a little lighter.

I hope it helps you too.
