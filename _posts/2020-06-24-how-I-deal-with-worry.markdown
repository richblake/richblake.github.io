I worry a lot. Here's a technique that I use and have shared with others, with love to help with that.

Sometimes that worry can be about an interview, or a workshop with lots of people, or just about a piece of work that I am doing.

Whatever it is, usually the worry is rooted in trying to predict the future - will this go well? What if its a disaster? What if there's conflict? Will this even be useful for people? Am I even doing the right thing?

I use this technique when I catch myself worrying. I find it useful, because frankly if someone else tries to tell me to stop worrying - it's not going to work.

I need to hear this from me.

## 5 minute technique to deal with worry

Find a quiet place where no one can hear you. I find it best if there's a mirror at face height, so the bathroom is a good place for this.

Start with a minute of silence - sometimes it helps me to focus on breathing deeply, in and out.

Think about the thing that's worrying you and **brainstorm all of the people in your life who will want you to do well.**

This helps remind me that I'm not alone in this endeavour, an easy thing to forget.

### Say these things out loud

Start with "I want to do well with [this interview/this workshop/this meeting]"

Then list all of the people **by name** that you can think will want you to do well. It feels weird, but keep saying this out loud.  

Start with the people you love in your life

"and I know my mum and dad want me to do well"

"and my sister and her husband want me to do well"

and narrow down to the people around you in this...

"and my boss wants me to do well"

"and the people I work with want me to do well - there's Sarah and Jane and Susan"

...and so on - as far as you can go in 2 - 3 minutes.

When you come to a stop, remind yourself that you want to do well and take another breath.

"I want to do well and all of these people want me to do well too."

Doing this makes me happy, taking a weight off of my shoulders.
