Iâ€™m volunteering half a day a month. If you work in government or at a charity then I can work with you.

These are some things that I have done recently

* spent time with people new to delivery management and gave advice about delivery management in government and where the communities are
* asked by the police central portfolio digital team to run a team lift-off workshop using the 'purpose to practice' liberating structure
* invited to deliver a talk on why stand-ups are precious during Hackney Council's delivery week

It's always best to start with a conversation about what help you need. So drop me a quick hello to arrange a coffee (either face to face or Google hangout).
