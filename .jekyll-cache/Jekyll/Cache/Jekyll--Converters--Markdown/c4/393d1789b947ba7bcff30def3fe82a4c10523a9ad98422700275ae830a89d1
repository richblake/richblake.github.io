I"ô<p>Iâ€™m volunteering half a day a month. If you work in government or at a charity then I can work with you.</p>

<p>These are some things that I have done recently</p>

<ul>
  <li>spent time with people new to delivery management and gave advice about delivery management in government and where the communities are</li>
  <li>asked by the police central portfolio digital team to run a team lift-off workshop using the â€˜purpose to practiceâ€™ liberating structure</li>
  <li>invited to deliver a talk on why stand-ups are precious during Hackney Councilâ€™s delivery week</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s always best to start with a conversation about what help you need. So drop me a quick hello to arrange a coffee (either face to face or Google hangout).</p>
