I"<p>I worry a lot.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be about an interview, or a workshop with lots of people, or just about a piece of work that I am doing. Whatever it is, usually the worry is rooted in trying to predict the future - will this go well? What if its a disaster? What if thereâ€™s conflict? Will this even be useful for people? Am I even doing the right thing?</p>

<p>Worry is a weight on your shoulders and I want to share a 5 minute exercise that I use regularly to keep myself grounded and give me strength.</p>
