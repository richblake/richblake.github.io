I"ï<p>I worry a lot (and its part of who I am).</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be about an interview, or a workshop with lots of people, or just about a piece of work that I am doing.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, usually the worry is rooted in trying to predict the future - will this go well? What if its a disaster? What if there‚Äôs conflict? Will this even be useful for people? Am I even doing the right thing?</p>

<p>I use this technique when I catch myself worrying. I find it useful, because frankly if someone else tries to tell me to stop worrying - it‚Äôs not going to work.</p>

<p>I need to hear this from me.</p>

<h2 id="5-minute-technique-to-deal-with-worry">5 minute technique to deal with worry</h2>

<p>Find a quiet place where no one can hear you. I find it best if there‚Äôs a mirror at face height, so the bathroom is a good place for this.</p>

<p>Start with a minute of silence - sometimes it helps me to focus on breathing deeply, in and out.</p>

<p>Think about the thing that‚Äôs worrying you and <strong>brainstorm all of the people in your life who will want you to do well.</strong></p>

<p>This helps remind me that I‚Äôm not alone in this endeavour, an easy thing to forget.</p>

<h3 id="say-these-things-out-loud">Say these things out loud</h3>

<p>Start with ‚ÄúI want to do well with [this interview/this workshop/this meeting]‚Äù</p>

<p>Then list all of the people <strong>by name</strong> that you can think will want you to do well. It feels weird, but keep saying this out loud.</p>

<p>Start with the people you love in your life</p>

<p>‚Äúand I know my mum and dad want me to do well‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äúand my sister and her husband want me to do well‚Äù</p>

<p>and narrow down to the people around you in this‚Ä¶</p>

<p>‚Äúand my boss wants me to do well‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Äúand the people I work with want me to do well - there‚Äôs Sarah and Jane and Susan‚Äù</p>

<p>‚Ä¶and so on - as far as you can go in 2 - 3 minutes.</p>

<p>When you come to a stop, remind yourself that you want to do well and take another breath.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI want to do well and all of these people want me to do well too.‚Äù</p>

<p>Doing this makes me happy. I hope it might help someone too.</p>
