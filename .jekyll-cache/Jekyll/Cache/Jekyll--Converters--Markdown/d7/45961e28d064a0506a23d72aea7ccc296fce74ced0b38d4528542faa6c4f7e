I"t<p>I worry a lot.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be about an interview, or a workshop with lots of people, or just about a piece of work that I am doing. Whatever it is, usually the worry is rooted in trying to predict the future - will this go well? What if its a disaster? What if there’s conflict? Will this even be useful for people? Am I even doing the right thing?</p>

<p>This is a technique I use when I catch myself worrying. I find it useful, because frankly if someone else tries to tell me to stop worrying - it’s not going to work. I need to hear this from me.</p>
